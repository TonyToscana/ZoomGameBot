# ZoomGameBot

WIP bot for the [Zoom Game](http://cutelifebot.github.io/sierpinski/)

Currently it is quick enough to follow the game until around 25k points with the current behavior (moving the cursor to the middle of the game field when it's away more than 150px in any direction).

**TODO**
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated behavior.
- [ ] Improve performance (if possible).
